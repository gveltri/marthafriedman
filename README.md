# Intro

This is the proto-type for a website that features an interactive sculpture gallery using three.js and phys.js. Three.js and phys.js are bundled with the working files.

# Thing to be worked

- create an environment for the sculpture

   gjv- worked on this a bit. not set on the textures, but I think the lighting is generally good. maybe we can put in another directional light come from the left as well as the right. when we add in more sculptures, we could have some direct light as if it were a gallery with really dramatic lighting. definitely something be worked on much further down the line

- get click and drag function working

   gjv- click and drag function working, yay. would like to add a way to move objects along the y-axis. currently, the object is moved where the raycaster intersects with the intersect_plane. perhaps we can use the keyboard arrow keys to move the object along the y-axis... or maybe scroll? scroll would be the most elegant but then it limits mobile users. both actually do. fuck

   


### Hairball Sculpture

- model hairball sculpture in rhino
- figure out how to load model into three.js
- two separate forms
- figure out reflectivity

## Future Sculpture

- figure out how to model the movement of rubber for her bigger rubber-y works
